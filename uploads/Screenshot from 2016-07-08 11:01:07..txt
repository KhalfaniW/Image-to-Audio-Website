 

Poor Richard's Almanack

1733

Courteous Reader.

I mighi in ihis place ai iempi io gain ihy Favour. by declaring ihai I wriie Almanacks wiiil no oiher View
ihan ihai ofihe publick Good; bui in ihis I should noi be sincere; and Men are now ardays ioo wise io be
deceiv'd by Prelences how specious soeyer. The plain Trth ofihe Maner is. 1 am excessive poor. and
my Wife. good Woman. is. 1 iell her. excessive proud; she cannoi bear. she says. lo sii spinning in her
Shiﬁ of Tow. while I do noihing bui gaze ai ihe Siars; and has ihreamed more ihan onceio bum all my
Books and Ranlinngmps (as she calls my Insirumems) ifI do noi make some proﬁlable Use ofihem for
ihe good of my Family. The Primer has offer’d me some considerable share ofihe Proﬁis. and I have ihus
begun lo comp1y wiih my Dame's desire.

Indeed ibis Moiive would have had Force enough lo have made me publish an Almanack many Years
since. had ii noi been overpowerd by my Regard for my good Friend and FellowrSiudeni. Mr. man
Leeds.whose Inieresi Iwas exireamly unwilling io hurt Bunhis Obslacle (I am far from speaking iiwiiil
Pleasure) is soon lo be removed. since inexorable Deaih. who was never known lo respeci Merii. has
already prepared ihe monal Dan. ihe falal Sisler has already exiended her desiroying Shears. and ihai
ingenious Man musl soon be iaken from us. He dies. by my Calculaiion made ai his Requesi. on gel. 17.
1733. 3 ho. 29 m. PM. anhe very inslani ofihe xxx ofxxx and xxx: By his own Calculaiion he will
survive iill ihe 26m ofihe same Monih. This small difference between us we have dispuied wheneverwe
have men ihese 9 Years pasi; bui ai lengih he is inclinable io agree wiiil my Judgmeni; Which of us is
mosl exaci. a linle Time will now deiermine. As iherefore ihese Provinces may noi longer expem io see
any ofhis Performances aﬁerihis Year. Iihink my selffree lo lake up ihe Task. and requesl a share of
ihe publick Encouragemeni; which I am ihe more apl io hope for on ihis Accouni. ihai ihe Buyer of my
Almanack may consider himself. noi only as purchasing an useful Uiensil. bul as performing an Am of
Chariiy. io his poor Friend and Servam
